## CodeForGood2018

I was selected (me on the left) to take part in J.P.Moragns Code For Good 2018.
A brief description of the hackathon can be described below.

"At a Code for Good hackathon, you'll collaborate with other coders to develop innovative technology solutions for nonprofit organizations. You'll also learn about starting a Technology career with us while being guided by the sharpest minds in our industry"

https://www.artlinkedinburgh.co.uk/ - the charity we hacked for focuses on supporting the right to participate in cultural life regardless of disability. During the Hackathon we created a website in which users would be able to filter based on what users could do and show activities that would be best suited for them, with meta data about the location, price and any other relevant information. 

The main focus of the project was filtering on what users could do, instead of filtering for activities that they can not do. 

:trophy: We also won the overall Github prize for most team commits for the Hackathon.

Github Repo for Project can be viewed here -> [GUTS2018](https://github.com/GregorKerr1996/GUTS2018)

Within this 48Hour long Hackathon, we were tasked of creating a tank bot to fight in an area in which the bot would have to move, shoot, pick up ammo and health and if our bot managed to get a kill, convert it by returning to our goal.
