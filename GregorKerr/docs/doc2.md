I was selected (me on the left) to take part in J.P.Moragns Code For Good.
A brief description of the hackathon can be described below.

"At a Code for Good hackathon, you'll collaborate with other coders to develop innovative technology solutions for nonprofit organizations. You'll also learn about starting a Technology career with us while being guided by the sharpest minds in our industry"
