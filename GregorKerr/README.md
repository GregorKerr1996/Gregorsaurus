# Website

My website can be accessed [Here](https://GregorKerr1996.github.io/Gregorsaurus/)


This is my personal website which includes Projects, Hackathons i have taken part of and any other applicable information.
I built this using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/) which is came from Facebook where they faced the problem of presenting documentation written in markdown and ease of deployment via Github pages.
